# DevFlow — Multi-Agent AI Engineering Framework

A portable, **framework for professional software development using multiple AI sub-agents** working as a coordinated team. Build production-quality features following the DevFlow lifecycle: Architecture → Planning → TDD Testing → Implementation → Code Review → Debug → Finalize.

Designed for **any tech stack**, integrated directly into **VS Code Copilot** (no external tools needed).

## 🚀 Quick Start

Install globally (works in any VS Code workspace):

```bash
# One-liner (macOS/Linux/Windows Git Bash)
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdias98/DevFlow/main/install.sh)
```

Then in any Copilot chat:

```
/devflow Implement user authentication with JWT tokens
```

DevFlow will automatically orchestrate 6 specialized AI sub-agents to design, plan, test, implement, review, and debug your feature.

## 📋 What Is DevFlow?

DevFlow is a **multi-agent framework** that simulates a professional engineering team:

| Agent | Responsibility | Output |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| 🧩 **Architect** | Requirements analysis, system design | Architecture specification |
| 📋 **Planner** | Task breakdown, execution planning | Implementation plan with code snippets |
| 🧪 **Tester** | **TDD:** Write failing tests FIRST | Failing test cases (red phase) |
| ⚙️ **Implementer** | Write minimal code to pass tests | Production code (green phase) |
| 🔍 **Reviewer** | Code quality, security, architecture validation | Code review findings |
| 🐞 **Debugger** | Root cause analysis (never guesses) | Debug logs + fixes |

Each agent has **clear responsibilities**, **strict role separation**, and **persistent memory** between phases.

## 💻 Commands Available

### Full Lifecycle
```
/devflow Build a REST API for managing users
```
Executes all 7 phases automatically: Architect → Plan → Test → Implement → Review → Debug → Finalize.

### Individual Phases
```
/devflow-architect   # Phase 1: Design
/devflow-plan        # Phase 2: Planning
/devflow-test        # Phase 3: TDD
/devflow-implement   # Phase 4: Implementation
/devflow-review      # Phase 5: Review
/devflow-debug       # Phase 6: Debug
```

### Agent Mode
```
@devflow Build a caching layer for product listings
```
Interacts with the full orchestrator agent.

### Iteration Rules

- **Tests FAIL** → Debugger → Implementer (retry)
- **Review blocker** → Implementer (fix issues)
- **Architecture flaw** → Architect (redesign)
- Max 3 retries per phase before escalating

## 🔧 Tech Stack Compatibility

DevFlow **detects your workspace's tech stack automatically**:

| Stack | Detection |
|-------|-----------|
| Node.js / TypeScript | `package.json`, `tsconfig.json` |
| .NET / C# | `*.csproj`, `*.sln` |
| Python | `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml` |
| Go | `go.mod` |
| Rust | `Cargo.toml` |
| Java | `pom.xml`, `build.gradle` |
| React | `vite.config.*`, `jest.config.*`, `vitest.config.*` |

Works with **any** language and framework.

## 📚 Key Features

✅ **TDD by Default** — Tests written BEFORE implementation (always)  
✅ **Architecture First** — No code without design spec  
✅ **Never Guesses** — Debugger performs systematic root cause analysis  
✅ **No External Tools** — Pure VS Code + Copilot (no npm packages, no docker, nothing)  
✅ **Portable** — Tech-stack agnostic, works anywhere  
✅ **Auto-Review** — Every implementation is automatically code-reviewed  
✅ **Documented Decisions** — Specs, plans, reviews, debug logs are saved  
✅ **Role Separation** — Each agent has clear, strict boundaries  

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- ✅ No data sent to external services (uses your local VS Code Copilot)
- ✅ No tracking, no analytics
- ✅ Open source — audit the code yourself
- ✅ Scripts are simple bash (inspect before running)

## ⚡ Performance

- **Install time:** ~5 seconds
- **First use:** Automatic workspace type detection
- **Response time:** Depends on feature complexity (typically 2-10 minutes per full lifecycle)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Commands not showing up?
1. Reload VS Code: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → Developer: Reload Window
2. Verify installation: `~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/github.copilot-dev/skills/`
3. Restart VS Code completely

### "garbled" or "permission denied" on install?
Check that the path is writable:
```bash
ls -la ~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/github.copilot-dev/
```

### Want to update?
Run the install script again — it will overwrite with the latest version.
