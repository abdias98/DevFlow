# DevFlow — Multi-Agent AI Engineering Framework

[![CI](https://github.com/abdias98/DevFlow/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/abdias98/DevFlow/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A portable **framework for professional software development using multiple AI sub-agents** working as a coordinated team. Build production-quality features following the DevFlow lifecycle: Brainstorm → Architecture → Plan (with TDD test code) → Confirm → Implement (Red→Green TDD cycle) → Review → Debug → Finalize.

Designed for **any tech stack**, installed globally in **VS Code, Claude Code, opencode, Antigravity**, or any **headless CLI** environment.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Install globally (one-time)

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdias98/DevFlow/main/install.sh)
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
> **Prerequisite:** [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) must be installed — the script uses Git Bash to run the installer. If you see "Git Bash not found", install Git for Windows first.
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdias98/DevFlow/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Installs the `@devflow` agent globally — available in **every workspace** without extra setup.

### Step 2: Reload VS Code

`Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Developer: Reload Window**

### Step 3: Use DevFlow in any workspace

```
@devflow Implement user authentication with JWT tokens
```

✅ Done. DevFlow orchestrates specialized roles across **8 phases**: Brainstormer → Validation Gate → Architect → Planner → Implementer (Red→Green TDD per task) → Reviewer → Debugger → Finalizer. A manual Tester helper is available on-demand for mid-implementation resume.

## ⬆️ What's New in 4.0.0

**Wave 7 — Mythos-class major.** DevFlow is now a framework that extracts maximum potential from any AI:

- 🔍 **Environment capability probe** — DevFlow detects what your editor supports (subagents, vision, terminal, filesystem) and activates or degrades features accordingly. Never breaks when a primitive is missing.
- 🔄 **Autonomous mode** — `DEVFLOW_AUTONOMOUS=true` starts a non-presential long-duration cycle. The framework manages persistence, async checkpoints, resume, and escalation. You initiate and leave; it runs to completion.
- 📸 **Vision verification** — when the environment supports vision, the Reviewer compares the approved mockup against the implemented UI (visual diff), and the Debugger can analyze screenshots of error states. Falls back to code-only review when vision is unavailable.
- 📐 **Adaptive skills** — skill prescriptiveness scales with the rigor level (`light`/`standard`/`deep`/`maximum`). At light rigor, the agent navigates autonomously with objectives; at maximum rigor, it follows each step literally with extra verification.
- 🧠 **Knowledge base bootstrap** — `/devflow-templates bootstrap-knowledge` retroactively populates the knowledge base by analyzing historical specs, reviews, debug-logs, and summaries. Every cycle makes the next one smarter.

**Also shipped in recent releases:**

- Wave 6 (3.3.0): Parallel subagents (Architect/Reviewer/Implementer parallel dispatch), fresh-context verifier subagent before review.
- Wave 5 (3.2.0): Progress honesty rules, reasoning-echo correction, cross-cycle knowledge base reads, adaptive rigor, work packet format.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full history.

### Interactive Editor Selection

When you run the installer, you'll see a prompt listing all available editor profiles:

```
📍 Select installation target:

  1) Visual Studio Code      [installed]
  2) Claude Code (CLI)       [installed]
  3) opencode (CLI AI Agent) [installed]
  4) Antigravity             [not detected]
  5) Generic (CLI / Headless)[always available]

Enter number [1-5]: 1
📍 Selected: Visual Studio Code
```

The installer:
- **Lists all editors** (regardless of installation status)
- **Shows installation status** for each (if detected on your system)
- **Always prompts**, even if only one editor is available
- **Allows installation** for undetected editors (in case you install later)

Reload or restart your selected editor if needed, then follow the installer's post-install message.

## 📋 What Is DevFlow?

DevFlow is a **multi-agent framework** that simulates a professional engineering team:

| Phase | Agent / Role | Responsibility | Output |
|-------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | 🧠 **Brainstormer** | Clarifying questions, goals, constraints, edge cases | Problem Statement |
| 2 | ⏸️ **Validation Gate** *(Orchestrator)* | Challenge assumptions, scan standards, flag risks before design | Validation report |
| 3 | 🧩 **Architect** | Requirements analysis, system design, **Stack Profile** | Architecture spec |
| 4 | 📋 **Planner** | Task breakdown + **complete test code per task** + HTML mockups (UI) | Plan with ready-to-paste tests |
| ⏸️ | — | **Confirmation Gate** — waits for user approval | — |
| 5 | ⚙️ **Implementer** | 🔴→🟢 Red→Green TDD cycle per task (creates tests, writes production code, informs user) | Production code + test files |
| 6 | 🔍 **Reviewer** | Code quality, security (OWASP), architecture validation | Code review findings |
| 7 | 🐞 **Debugger** | Root cause analysis (never guesses) | Debug logs + fixes |
| 8 | 🚀 **Finalizer** | Verifies completion, generates summary, cleans memory | Final report |
| — | 🧪 **Tester** *(manual helper)* | Creates a specific failing test from the plan on demand | Failing test file |
| — | 🔧 **Refactorer** *(standalone)* | Scope-locked code improvement without behavior change | Refactor report |
| — | 🩹 **Bug-Fixer** *(standalone)* | Reproduce → Isolate → Fix reported bugs | Bug-fix report |
| — | ⚡ **Feature Agent** *(standalone)* | Lightweight TDD cycle for small-medium features | Feature report |

> **Important:** DevFlow agents follow the active execution mode. In **Pair mode**, agents create test files and tell you the exact command to run — you maintain full control. In **Standard mode**, agents auto-execute tests, branches, and commits for convenience. In **CI mode**, the cycle fails fast. In **Autonomous mode**, the framework manages the cycle non-presentially with async checkpoints and resume. Push and PR creation are **never** auto-executed in any mode.

Each role has **clear responsibilities**, **strict role separation**, and **persistent memory** between phases.

## 💻 Usage in Copilot Chat

### Full lifecycle (recommended)
```
@devflow Build a REST API for managing users
```
Runs all phases: Brainstorm → Architect → Plan+TDD → ⏸️ Confirm → Implement (Red→Green TDD) → Review → Debug → Finalize

### Individual phases via slash commands
```
/devflow-brainstorm   Clarify requirements and define scope
/devflow-architect    Design a component or system
/devflow-plan         Break down a feature (includes test code + UI mockups)
/devflow-implement    Start implementation (Red→Green TDD cycle per task)
/devflow-test         Manual helper: create a specific failing test from the plan
/devflow-review       Review code quality & security (cycle or standalone)
/devflow-debug        Debug a failing test (cycle or standalone)
/devflow-finalize     Generate final summary and verify completion
```

### Standalone agents (no full lifecycle needed)
```
/devflow-refactor     Scope-locked refactoring of existing code
/devflow-bug-fix      Reproduce → Isolate → Fix a reported bug
/devflow-feature      Implement a small-medium feature (lightweight TDD)
```

### Bring PR reviews back into DevFlow

When a PR from a DevFlow cycle gets reviewed — by a person or another review agent — the findings come back into the framework: escapes per cycle, lessons in the project's knowledge base and in the framework memory.

```
/devflow-review intake 1065                                 One PR, open or already merged
/devflow-review intake watch start owner/repo 30m           Collect review comments every 30 min
/devflow-review intake --pending                            Classify what was collected, with you
/devflow-review intake watch status | stop
```

- **No repository is watched by default.** Name it, or run `watch start` with no repository and pick from the list of yours (★ = has DevFlow cycles on this machine).
- The job polls only **open** PRs of DevFlow cycles; a merged or closed one is read only when you name it.
- It is read-only on GitHub (needs `gh`, logged in), runs with your system's scheduler (systemd `--user`, launchd or cron) and asks before installing anything. `devflow-ctl status` tells every agent which PRs have comments waiting.

## 📦 Installation Methods

### Method 1: Quick Install (Recommended)

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdias98/DevFlow/main/install.sh)
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
> **Prerequisite:** [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) must be installed — the script uses Git Bash to run the installer. If you see "Git Bash not found", install Git for Windows first.
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdias98/DevFlow/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Method 2: From Cloned Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdias98/DevFlow.git
cd DevFlow
bash install.sh
```

### Method 3: Pinned / Verifiable Install

The quick-install path always tracks `main`. To install a known release instead,
pin the ref and verify it out-of-band before running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdias98/DevFlow.git
cd DevFlow
git verify-tag v4.20.0        # needs the maintainer's public key; fails closed on bad signature
git checkout v4.20.0
bash install.sh
```

Or let the installer fetch the ref for you (it prints the installed commit SHA
and verifies signed tags when `gpg` is available):

```bash
DEVFLOW_REF=v4.20.0 bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdias98/DevFlow/main/install.sh)
```

### Method 4: Uninstall

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdias98/DevFlow/main/uninstall.sh)
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
> **Prerequisite:** [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) must be installed — the script uses Git Bash to run the uninstaller. If you see "Git Bash not found", install Git for Windows first.
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdias98/DevFlow/main/uninstall.ps1 | iex
```

## 🔧 Tech Stack Compatibility

DevFlow **detects your workspace's tech stack dynamically** by analyzing the content of your configuration files.

Rather than relying on hardcoded lists, agents read files like `package.json`, `*.csproj`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, or `build.gradle` to extract the full technology profile—including frameworks, ORMs, linters, and test runners.

Works with **any** language and framework out of the box. All engineering standards are technology-agnostic with illustrative examples that adapt to your detected stack.

---

## AGENTS.md — Skip the Stack Discovery

DevFlow can read an `AGENTS.md` file from your project to skip the exhaustive general codebase exploration during the Architect phase. When the file is found, the Architect agent reads it and uses its contents in place of automatically mapping your folder structure, naming conventions, tech stack, and architecture patterns.

**Valid locations** (searched automatically): project root (`AGENTS.md`) or any subdirectory (e.g., `docs/AGENTS.md`).

### What steps are skipped when AGENTS.md is present

| Step skipped | What it covers |
|---|---|
| Sub-step 1 — Full project structure | Folder hierarchy, module boundaries |
| Sub-step 2 — Naming conventions | File, class, function, route naming |
| Sub-step 4 — Tech stack details | Frameworks, ORMs, build tools, test runners |
| Sub-step 5 — Architecture patterns | MVC, CQRS, layered, feature-based, etc. |
| Sub-step 6 — Conventions for similar features | Reference templates from existing features |

Sub-steps 3 (reference implementation), 7 (reusability inventory), and 8 (test architecture analysis) are still run — scoped to the feature being built using the context from `AGENTS.md`.

### Suggested AGENTS.md format

```markdown
# AGENTS.md — Project metadata for AI agents

## Tech Stack
- Runtime / Language: {e.g., Node.js 20 / TypeScript 5}
- Framework: {e.g., Next.js 14 App Router}
- Styling: {e.g., Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui}
- Database + ORM: {e.g., PostgreSQL + Prisma}
- Auth: {e.g., next-auth v5 with JWT}
- Test runner: {e.g., Vitest + React Testing Library}
- Package manager: {e.g., pnpm}

## Folder Structure
```
src/
  app/          # Next.js App Router pages and layouts
  components/   # Shared UI components
  lib/          # Utilities and helpers
  server/       # Server-side logic (services, repositories)
  types/        # Shared TypeScript types
prisma/         # Schema and migrations
tests/          # Integration and e2e tests
```

## Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (`UserCard.tsx`)
- Server actions: camelCase (`createUser.ts`)
- API routes: kebab-case (`/api/user-profiles`)
- DB models: PascalCase singular (`User`, `OrderItem`)

## Architecture Patterns
- App Router with server components by default; `use client` only when needed
- Server actions in `src/server/actions/` for mutations
- Repository layer in `src/server/repositories/` for data access
- Zod for all input validation (server and client)

## Test Conventions
- Unit tests alongside source files: `{name}.test.ts`
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Factories in `tests/factories/`
- Run: `pnpm test` (watch: `pnpm test:watch`, coverage: `pnpm test:coverage`)

## Key Third-Party Abstractions
- `useSession()` from next-auth — do NOT build custom auth  
- `prisma` client from `src/lib/prisma.ts` — single shared instance  
- `cn()` from `src/lib/utils.ts` — class name merging  
```

> **Strongly recommended:** Create an `AGENTS.md` file in your project root describing your stack, folder structure, naming conventions, and test tooling. DevFlow reads it automatically at the start of every Architect phase and skips general codebase exploration — significantly speeding up analysis and improving output accuracy. The more complete it is, the better DevFlow performs.

## 📚 Key Features

### Core Lifecycle
✅ **TDD by Default** — Plan includes complete test code per task; Implementer executes Red→Green cycle and informs you of the exact commands to verify. You run the tests.
✅ **UI Mockups** — Planner generates HTML wireframes with component annotations for every frontend feature
✅ **API Contracts** — Every endpoint defined explicitly (method, path, request/response shapes, error codes) before any code is written; Reviewer validates the implementation against the contract
✅ **Risk Assessment** — Architect rates risk per design decision (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW); Planner converts HIGH risks into task-level flags with rollback steps
✅ **Definition of Done** — Brainstormer captures explicit success criteria; Finalizer verifies each one before closing the cycle
✅ **Confirmation Gate** — Implementation never starts automatically; you approve the plan before any code is written (auto-approved in CI/Autonomous mode)
✅ **Architecture First** — No code without a design spec
✅ **Never Guesses** — Debugger performs systematic root cause analysis
✅ **Accessibility Built-in** — Planner adds a11y checklist (WCAG 2.1 AA) to every UI task; Reviewer validates it
✅ **Private Engineering Standards** — Operates as a Senior Engineering team applying 21 standards (SOLID, Clean Architecture, Design Principles, Design Patterns, Project Design, Security, Performance, Concurrency, Error Handling, Logging, State & Data Lifecycle, Data Persistence, Integration Consumption, REST API, Event-Driven Architecture, UI Design, User Experience, Accessibility, Testing, Git Conventions, Dependencies) with conditional loading based on feature type
✅ **Dynamic Stack Detection** — Tech-stack agnostic. Agents dynamically analyze your config files to extract the exact framework, ORM, and testing tools
✅ **AGENTS.md Support** — Place an `AGENTS.md` in your project root; DevFlow reads it and skips general exploration
✅ **Stacked PRs (Manual)** — Optional Stack Mode splits large features into layered branches. DevFlow prepares branches and provides commands; you create PRs manually when ready
✅ **Auto-Review** — Every implementation is automatically code-reviewed (includes API contract, accessibility, dependency audit)
✅ **Documented Decisions** — Specs, plans, reviews, debug logs, refactor reports, bug-fix reports, and feature summaries saved to `docs/devflow/`
✅ **Actionable Next Steps** — Finalizer outputs follow-up features as user stories, not vague suggestions
✅ **Role Separation** — Each agent has clear, strict boundaries
✅ **You Control Execution** — DevFlow never creates PRs automatically, and always asks for approval before applying changes (except in CI/Autonomous mode)

### Mythos-Class Features (4.0.0)
✅ **Parallel Subagents** — Architect explores in parallel (4 subagents), Reviewer reviews in parallel (3 dimensions: security, performance, architecture), Implementer dispatches independent tasks as parallel waves. Sequential fallback when the editor doesn't support subagents.
✅ **Pre-Review Verifier** — A fresh-context verifier subagent catches missing files, scope drift, and plan deviations before the Reviewer spends its budget on deeper analysis.
✅ **Environment Capability Probe** — DevFlow detects what your editor supports (subagents, vision, terminal, filesystem) and activates or degrades features accordingly. Never breaks when a primitive is missing.
✅ **Autonomous Mode** — `DEVFLOW_AUTONOMOUS=true` starts a non-presential long-duration cycle with async checkpoints, send-to-user escalation, and resume from last incomplete phase.
✅ **Vision Verification** — When the environment supports vision, the Reviewer compares mockups against the implemented UI (visual diff) and the Debugger analyzes screenshots of error states. Code-only fallback when vision is unavailable.
✅ **Adaptive Rigor** — The Planner classifies feature complexity (`light`/`standard`/`deep`/`maximum`). Skill prescriptiveness scales inversely — less scaffolding for capable models on trivial tasks, full scaffolding for frontier tasks.
✅ **Cross-Cycle Knowledge Base** — The Finalizer extracts learnings after each cycle. All mid-cycle agents read them. `/devflow-templates bootstrap-knowledge` retroactively populates from historical artifacts. Every cycle makes the next one smarter.
✅ **Work Packet Format** — Plan tasks are structured as work packets (Goal, Context, Constraints, Acceptance, Deliverables) instead of micro-steps. Capable models operate with more autonomy.
✅ **Progress Honesty** — Framework-wide rules that ground every progress claim in tool results, eliminate fabricated status reports, and let capable models act without unnecessary narration.

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- ✅ No data sent to external services (uses your local AI editor — VS Code Copilot, Claude Code, opencode, Antigravity, etc.)
- ✅ No tracking, no analytics
- ✅ Open source — audit the code yourself
- ✅ Scripts are simple bash (inspect before running)
